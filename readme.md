# Election Results

## Motivation
My motivation for this project was to show D3 on my portfolio! I've used it quite a bit professionally, but I haven't used it much outside of work!

## Code Style
I stick to standard.js for JavaScript.

## Features
This map matches the election result data to a topojson using D3. It does have tooltips built in.
